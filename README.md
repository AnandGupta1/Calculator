Output

Enter an operator (+, -, *,): *
Enter two operands: 1.5
4.5
1.5 * 4.5 = 6.8
The * operator entered by the user is stored in the operator variable. And, the two operands, 1.5 and 4.5 are stored in variables firstNumber and secondNumber respectively.


Since, the operator * matches the case case '*':, the control of the program jumps to

printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf",firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber * secondNumber);
